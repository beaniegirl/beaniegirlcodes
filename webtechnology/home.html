  			<p>Hi There!</br> </br>If you haven't noticed by the result of the title tag yet, I'm Rebeca Monis, also known as 'Register number 4' or '18BCA41004' or simply, '4'. This website is my submission for the first assignment in my Web Technology class. If you have stumbled upon it by chance (I don't know how you would), you're about to fill your head with unnecessary facts about me. You have been forewarned. Here's a picture of our planet, because why would I put up my picture on a public page? Also, this particular picture fits the theme of the page as a bonus! </br> </br> <img src ="https://room.eu.com/images/contents/issue11-world-needs-strong-space-governance-system.jpg" class="center" ></br></br>I really don't have a lot to say, nor do I have to say a lot but I do need to somehow fill this page with text so here goes! For underwhelming facts about me click 'About'.
